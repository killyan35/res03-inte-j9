                        Harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of 
                        chicken legs and bread. <q>"Thanks,"</q> said Sirius, opening it, 
                        grabbing a drumstick, sitting down on the cave floor, 
                        and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. 
                        <q>"I've been living off rats mostly. Can't steal too much

                        Said Harry angrily. <q>"A great big dragon keeps popping up

                        He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, 
                        but Hermione refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy,
                        and there was no point in staying without her. He therefore
                        had to endure over an hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent
                        half the lesson telling everyone that the position of Mars 
                        with relation to Saturn at that moment meant that people
                        born in July were in great danger of sudden, violent deaths.

                        <q>"Well, that's good,"</q> said Harry loudly, his temper getting
                        the better of him, <q>"just as long as it's not drawn-out.

                        eye for the first time in days, but Harry was still feeling
                        too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest of the
                        lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the
                        table with his wand.

                        Harry and Ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory. 
                        As Harry pulled on his pajamas, he looked over at Nevilles bed.
                        True to his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione 
                        about Neville's parents. As Harry took off his glasses 
                        and climbed into his four-poster, he imagined how it must 
                        feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then he remembered the milk-white face of the screaming 
                        boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year
                        later. . . . It was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up
                        at the canopy of his bed in the darkness, it all came 
                        back to Voldemort. ... He was the one who had torn these
                        families apart, who had ruined all these lives. . . . 
                        Ron and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their 
                        exams, which would finish on the day of the third task, 
                        but they were putting most of their efforts into helping
                        Harry prepare.
